### nextcloud
The main reason for the webhosting is running some clouds to store private data online.

### imscp
In the beginning the server was running on imscp, as it was already prepared from ip-projects. \
Even after php7.1 was outated, imscp didn't supported php7.2 without byuing plugins. \
Therefore, I switched to virtualmin in december 2019.
